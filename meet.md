Colin (vocals, guitar) is has been living in Wisconsin for most of his life. He really enjoys playing all sorts of music, and he expands his style according to whichever group he's playing with.  Some of his major influences include Rush, Yes, Stabbing Westward, Mew, Living Colour, Caroline's Spine, Dream Theater, Nickel Creek, Devin Townsend, Killswitch Engage, Paramore, Heartsounds, Sky Eats Airplane, and Ian Thornley to name just a few.  He hopes his music fits somewhere in that mess of artists.  These days he is working on expanding and writing his own music.  Playing with Fly Casual has been a great time and a good challenge, and he feels really lucky to be working with such a fine group of people.
